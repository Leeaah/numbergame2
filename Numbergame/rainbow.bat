ECHO What the fuck did you just fucking type about me, you little bitch? I will have you know I graduated top of my class at MIT, and I have been involved in numerous secret raids with Anonymous, and I have over 300 confirmed DDoSes. I am trained in online trolling and I am the top hacker in the entire world. You are nothing to me but just another virus host. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on the Internet, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with typing that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we chat over IRC I am tracing your IP with my damn bare hands so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your computer. You are fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can hack into your files in over seven hundred ways, and that is just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in hacking, but I have access to the entire arsenal of every piece of malware ever created and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the world wide web, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little clever comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking fingers. But you could not, you did not, and now you are paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit code all over you and you will drown in it. You are fucking dead, kiddo.
